I had no Internet for 4 days and this is what happened.

# TODO

* remove not needed dependencies (npm and bower ones)

#Install

Install dependencies.

```
	npm install
```

Install bower dependencies

```
	bower install
```

#Run

Running can be done with gulp

```
	gulp run

Or with the `launch.sh` (be sure to make it executable)

```
./launch.sh
```

#How I use it?

In `config.json` you can specify a path to a folder of `*.sh` files.
Currently the `example_scripts` is loaded.
